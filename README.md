# Mason-Ross-Programming-Portfolio
This is a portfolio of some of my python work
the python projects in this portfolio include

Evolution Simulator
--------------------
This is an "evolution simulator" that creates a starting animal population with a random set of positive attributes,
such as sharp teeth or speed.
The program uses a genetic algorithm that kills the two weakest animals, and breeds the two strongest, creating two "children" with similar attributes to their parents.
this means that the population typically gets stronger with each generation.
you may enjoy tinkering with the population size and number of generations. the two generations strengths are compared at the end so you can see how strong they get.
hint- the max score is 255, and the worst theoretical score is 0.

Stack Implementation
--------------------
This program is simply an implementation of a stack data structure and its functions.
the user may push, pop, or peek the stack.
the stack does have error checking, such as making sure it is not empty before allowing the user to pop.
Although simple, this code is fun, and visualises the concept well.
I developed this in year 12, to assist with my understanding of what I was learning at school

Charli v1.3
--------------
This program is one of my earliest "large" projects, I programmed this while isolating in early 2021 when I was 16, so please dont mind some of the "unpythonic" practices.
Charli is an intellegent voice assistant, in the same vein as things like Siri, or Amazons Alexa.
Charli has many abilities that I added over time.
She uses the google speech recognition API to get your voice as a string. she then breaks down the string, finds the appropriate function, and executes the command.
she has the ability to do arithmatic,Generate random numbers, open programs, and even shut down the PC.
try it out with "hey charli, work out 10 plus 10"
Please note, 
In the .zip file attached, Charli will NOT be able to open files or send emails. These features required me to have personal information such as passwords or emails
in the code, which I did not feel comfortable including within the published version. 
There is an update log that highlights the new commands added as well as the development of Charli.
Despite not quite meeting my programming standards today, I have included this on here because I had a great time making it, and I believe it shows how far I have come.

**Insertion sort**
----------------------
This program is based on an exam question involving the implementation of quicksort.
While the question largely focused on what became my 'person' data structure, I felt that I could take the insertion sort algorithm I had made and make something with 
a bit more meat on it's bones. I then added functionality to sort by gender and ethnicities, and also randomised the order of the list each time, so to prove that the algorithm was
successfully doing its job.
To give this code a go, open it in any Python IDLE from Python 3.9.

# Mason-Ross-Programming-Portfolio
This is a portfolio of some of my work in C.
The work I have added to my portfolio currently consists of:

Project_Manager
---------------
This project is an exploration into the workings of terminal commands and bash.
my project manager tool allows users to manipulate their unix system by inputting commands, such as
creating tags, moving files, creating directories, viewing folders. 
I developed it in a virtual machine running ubuntu, and it required me to alow the use of additional memory, so keep this in mind if you choose to 
run the program on your own. 
the user is intended to download all files, and then use the terminal to run the commands.
More detailed running instructions including a command list can be found in the project_manager zip file.
This piece of work was set as an assignment in my first year of university.

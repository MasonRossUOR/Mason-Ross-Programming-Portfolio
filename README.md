# Mason-Ross-Programming-Portfolio
This is a portfolio of some of my work in C++
This part of the portfolio consists of:

GCF Program
-------------
This program randomly generates 100,000 pairs of numbers.
It then uses two algorithms, one iterative, and one recursive, to find the greatest common factors of the pairs.
For a bit more fun, the code will also time the two algorithms to see how long they take to find the GCF of all pairs.
